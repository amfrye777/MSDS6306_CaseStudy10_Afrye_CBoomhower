Now having a clearer understanding of the association between as-is and planned Efak exports, the next step is to review the as-is export trend, seasonality, and remaining coincidental components. Utilizing the STL function, we are able to separate these components and plot them one after the other.

Referring to the trend segment below, it is clear there is a nearly linear increase in exports over time. The seasonality component indicates a large number of exports toward the beginning of each year. There appears to be a consistent decrease in exports during the Summer months before steadily increasing again each year. Finally, the remainder plot displays anomalies beyond observed Efak export trend and seasonal behaviors.
