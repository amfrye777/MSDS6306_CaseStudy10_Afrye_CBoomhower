Now that all EDA steps are complete, we are ready to run our forecast models. Several models are available for time series forecasting. The models used in this analysis are:

* Simple Exponential Smoothing (SES)
* Holt's Linear Trend (HLT)
* Holt's Exponential Trend (HET)
* Holt's Damped Linear Trend (HDLT)
* Holt's Damped Exponential Trend (HDET)
* Holt-Winters' Seasonal Additive Model (HWSA)
* Holt-Winters' Seasonal Multiplicative Model (HWSM)

```{r ExecAllSmooth}
```

The Akaikeâ€™s Information Criterion (AIC), Akaike's Information Criterion Corrected (AICc), and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) are Maximum Likelihood Estimators (MLE). These are important measures of goodness of fit, and as such, their values are extracted from each model's summary output and assigned to a data frame for later analysis. The resulting data frame is as follows.

Minimum AIC/AICc/BIC values are highlighted in green, representing the best goodness of fit for the corresponding models. The Holt-Winters' Seasonal Additive Model contains the lowest AIC and AICc values whereas the Simple Exponential Smoothing model has the lowest value for BIC. Given that the Holt-Winters' Seasonal Additive and Simple Exponential Smoothing models have the smallest values, this is an early indicator that these models may be the best fit for Efak as-is data.

```{r ComputeModelMLE, include=FALSE}
```

To further illustrate the difference in MLE measures, the AIC/AICc/BIC values are plotted for each model type. As indicted in the previous table, the Holt-Winters' Seasonal Additive and Simple Exponential Smoothing models depict the smallest measures. It is worth noting that the Holt-Winters' Seasonal Additive model has the second smallest BIC value and that while its multiplicative version has the second smallest AIC/AICc values, the multiplicative model portrays the largest BIC value. For these reasons, it is important to consider all available measures holistically as will be done further momentarily.

```{r PlotModelMLE}
```

Similar to AIC/AICc/BIC measures, various summary measures of forecast accuracy exist in the form of error values. The error measures used in this analysis are:

* Mean Error (ME)
* Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
* Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
* Mean Percentage Error (MPE)
* Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
* Mean Absolute Scaled Error (MASE)
* Autocorrelation of Errors at Lag 1 (ACF1)

The below table provides a summary of all error measures with the smallest model error highlighted for each error type. Since the Holt-Winters' Seasonal Additive model has the smallest AIC/AICc values as discussed in our MLE review above, the fact that this additive model portrays four of the smallest error values seems rather significant. Of additional note, the Simple Exponential Smoothing model depicts at least one of the smallest error measures. For these reasons, the Holt-Winters' Seasonal Additive and Simple Exponential Smoothing models will be chosen for Chulwalar Efak export forecasting analysis.

Before any forecasts are made, it is important to visualize model fit for as-is historical data. The following plot provides an overlayed view of raw as-is data and model fit lines. The Holt-Winters' Seasonal Additive model is more representative of seasonal changes in the raw data whereas the Simple Exponential Smoothing model provides a clearer summary of mean trend behavior.

```{r PlotSES_HWSA}
```

The Simple Exponential Smoothing model is again plotted below with the raw as-is historical data. While this model does not appear to be sensitive to seasonal fluctuations in exports, it does provide a good representation of overall trend. The extent to which seasonal fluctuations are smoothed is dependent on the smoothing parameter, or alpha. This smoothing parameter operates as a weighted average in which older values are less influential on model forecasts.

The model's export forecast is indicated by the blue line for the year 2014. Since this model calculates a single forecasting constant which remains for all of 2014, it does not account for the positive trends observed among historical data. This, along with the loss of a seasonal component when forecasting, is the Simple Exponential Smoothing model's biggest weakness.

```{r SimpleExponential}
```

When reviewing the Holt-Winters' Seasonal Additive forecast with raw historical data below, it is clear this model not only depicts the export positive trend in the future, but it also accounts for the effects of seasonality. The model parameter gamma incorporates seasonal smoothing into the model calculation. In this case, gamma is set to a default estimated value. These additional components provide evidence to suggest the Holt-Winters' Seasonal Additive model is a better fit for forecasting as-is to future export data.
