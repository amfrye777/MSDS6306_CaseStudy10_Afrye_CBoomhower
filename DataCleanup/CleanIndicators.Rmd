```{r read_chunk_CleanIndicators, cache=FALSE}
knitr::read_chunk(paste0(DataCleanup,'/CleanIndicators.R'))
```

Finally, to clean the external indicators data, we separate each indicator group into individual vectors. Then, as done previously, we convert each new vector into a time series. Lastly, we review each time series output to ensure they match what we expect to see.

```{r CleanIndicators_toVector}
```

```{r CleanIndicators_toTS}
```
