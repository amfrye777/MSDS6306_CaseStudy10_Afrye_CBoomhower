To clean our as-is Chulwar data, we first separate each export group (e.g. TotalAsIs, Efak, Wuge, etc.) into individual vectors. Following this, we convert each new vector into a time series. Finally, we review each time series output to ensure they match our expectations.

```{R CleanAsIs_toVector, include = FALSE}
```

```{r CleanAsIs_toTimeSeries, include = FALSE}
```
