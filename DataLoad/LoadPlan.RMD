```{r read_chunk_LoadPlan, cache=FALSE}
knitr::read_chunk(paste0(DataLoad,'/LoadPlan.R'))
```

Similarly, the second data set loaded is the planned export data. These data are also obtained from SMU 2DS and loaded as follows:

```{r LoadPlan}
```

Once again, the data structure and subset rows were reviewed to confirm succesful import.

Similar to the as-is data set, structure and subset row review indicates there are multiple groups (TotalPlan, Efak, Wuge, TotalEtel, BlueEtel, RedEtel, YearPlan, and TotalPlan_2014) of data within the single CSV file that need divided accordingly. In order to do so, these data will need parsed during cleanup and assigned to a data frame for efficient analysis.
