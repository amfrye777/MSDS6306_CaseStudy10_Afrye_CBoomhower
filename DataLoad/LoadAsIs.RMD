To start, we need to load our As Is Chulwar Data. This data has been sourced from the SMU 2DS platform Unit 10.2 Overview page.

```{R LoadAsIs}
AsIsChulwar<-read.csv(paste0(DataLoad,"/ImportedAsIsDataChulwalar.csv"), header = FALSE)
```

With our data loaded, lets review the structure and a small subset of data from the output to give a baseline for cleanup.

```{R AsIsLoadStructure}
  ##Review Structure
str(AsIsChulwar)

  ##Review Head 15 Records
formattable(head(AsIsChulwar,30))

  ##Review Tail 15 Records
formattable(tail(AsIsChulwar,30))

```

After reviewing this subset of data, it is apparent we have some cleanup to do. It appears we have one variable loaded that contains a delimited list of values by semicolons(;). All export group forcasts have also been combined into this one variable by repeating month/year data for each export group. We will need to parse this data to create a data structure that is easier to analyze.
